# DEPRECATED - NOT UNDER DEVELOPMENT ANYMORE

## Catena - the yeoman-generator for fullstack AngularJS & Meteor apps

Catena is a chain of craters.

`Meteor, AngularJS, Angular-UI, Bootstrap, User handling, Velocity, Jasmine & NightWatch out of the box.`

## Prerequisites

To run a [Meteor][meteor] application, we have to install Meteor on our machine.

On Mac & Linux you can do this:
```bash
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

and on Windows, install it via the official [Meteor installer][meteorinstaller]


To clone the repository, you will need git. You can download and install git from [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

To be able to install the node packages, you will need to install node.js and its package manager (npm).
You can download and install node.js from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

You will also need to have yeoman installed:

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

and starrynight to run our browser tests:

```bash
npm install -g starrynight
```

## Getting Started

To get started, just install the catena generator & run it.

```bash
npm install -g generator-catena-angular-meteor-bootstrap
```

### Create new project with the Catena Generator

To create a new project create an empty folder and change directory

```bash
mkdir myNewProject
cd myNewProject
```

then run the generator and follow the questions.

```bash
yo catena-angular-meteor-bootstrap
```

### Run the Application

To start your new project, simply run Meteor. Meteor will install all dependencies and run your project.

```bash
meteor
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Demo Module

If you have selected that you want to generate a demo module, the tweet module in client and server is created. You can browse it via. To create a tweet, you have to be logged in. Either create a new one, or use the admin user which was created on first startup.

`http://localhost:3000/tweets`.

## Sub-Generators

As soon you have created your application, you can create modules & angular modules.

For all Sub-Generators you will have to provide a name.
You can do that by a single word or if you have more words add it between ""

### Create Module (Client & Server)

This module creates the angular module, a default collection, server code and tests skeletons.

```bash
yo catena-angular-meteor-bootstrap:module newModule
```

or

```bash
yo catena-angular-meteor-bootstrap:module "new Module"
```

### Create Angular Module (Client)

This module creates the angular module and tests skeletons for client and nightWatch.

```bash
yo catena-angular-meteor-bootstrap:angular-module newModule
```

or

```bash
yo catena-angular-meteor-bootstrap:angular-module "new Module"
```

## Testing

This project uses [Velocity][velocity], [Jasmine][jasmine] & [NightWatch][nightWatch] for testing.

### Running Jasmine Tests

Since [Meteor][meteor] & our application uses [Velocity][velocity], the [Jasmine][jasmine] tests are run automatically. You will recognize a dot in the upper right corner.

### Running NightWatch Tests

Our application uses also NightWatch for browser automated tests. I have setup NightWatch with starrynight, so to run it, we run this command in another terminal window. Your application should be running with Meteor.

```bash
starrynight run-tests --framework nightwatch
```

## FAQ

### Mac OS
- If you are using Mac OS X El Capitan, be sure you have installed all updates from the App Store.

#### Why can I not run my NightWatch tests?
- Try to install and start Xcode from the App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12
- Update your Java version from: https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US or https://www.java.com/de/

#### UI does not update my Jasmine test and I don't know if they are run successfully?
- Try just execute the tests with:
```bash
meteor --test
```
- It takes some time to start the mirrors, it's faster for unit tests than for integration tests
